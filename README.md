# MechWarrior 5 Save Files
This is a very simple project to make some uber-powerful early-campaign saves for MechWarrior 5, Mercenaries.



## Why?  Isn't this cheating?

MW5: Mercs is a single player / co-op only game.  Do what you want.  There is nobody to compete with.

When I was I kid I'd have been happy to grind out all the assets I might need or want to complete the more difficult missions at the end of the story.  As it stands today, I don't have time to grind for gear.  I have a day job to work, three kids to raise, a wife to please, and other hobbies and interests.

So, this is my way around the grind.  On the off chance I have an hour to kill, I can fire up the game and *just play the missions*, which is what I really wanted to do any way.  Building / tweaking mechs === fun.  Driving mechs === fun.  Smashing things with mechs === fun.  Managing a mercenary mech company... less fun.

## What is this?

The save file contained in this repository is for MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries.  It has the following properties:

* You are very early in the campaign.  You have completed three missions and it is now time to name your company.
* You have one of each mech in the game (as of 2021-11-1) in cold storage.
* You have 5,000 of each top-tier weapon.
* You have 25B C-Bills.

Other than than insane OP starting advantage, there is nothing else here.  The file was generated from the un-modified, vanilla game.

Enjoy!
